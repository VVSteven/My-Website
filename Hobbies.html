    <h2>About Car Modeling</h2>
    <p><strong>Opening Statement:</strong> When I have free time, I like to work on model cars.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A model car is a plastic mold of a real car. In order to work on them, you will have to assemble the parts, such as the tires, engine, and interior. You are also free to choose a color that will make you feel excited. </p>
    <p><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> I have a connection to modeling cars because the cars I create are the ones I want to own and most importantly drive.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits and Enjoyment:</strong> The benefit I found was living with the mistakes that I have caused, either to the body or the paint. I get enjoyment from it because it is peaceful, and seeing a car complete is fulfilling.</p>
